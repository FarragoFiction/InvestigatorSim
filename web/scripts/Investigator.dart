    TODO
    An investigator has a list of days (which will have data on what information was gathered on each day).
    TODO an investigator should eventually have more global stats as well such as keeping track if they're doing good, doing poorly, flirting, etc.
    should also have methods like "check each day to see when the most recent time we knew about temperature was"
